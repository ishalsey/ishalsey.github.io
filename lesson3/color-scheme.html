    <h1>Color Scheme</h1>
    <h3>LightBlue Gradient & Black Text</h3>
    <p class="color">linear-gradient(0deg, rgba(34,193,195,1) 0%, rgba(242,255,254,1) 100%)</p>
    <p>I wanted to make a color scheme that would go with the theme of weather so i chose a light blue gradient white for clear skies and good weahter but I also am adding a background image to show different kinds of weather so people who visit get a better show of the site it may just show up at the top with the gradient under it connecting to it.</p>
